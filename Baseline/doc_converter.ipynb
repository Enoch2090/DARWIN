       "dict_values(['BACKGROUND: Amidst concerns regarding the capacity of the public health system to respond rapidly and appropriately to threats such as pandemics and terrorism, along with changing population health needs, governments have focused on strengthening public health systems. A key factor in a robust public health system is its workforce. As part of a nationally funded study of public health renewal in Canada, a policy analysis was conducted to compare public health human resources-relevant documents in two Canadian provinces, British Columbia (BC) and Ontario (ON), as they each implement public health renewal activities. METHODS: A content analysis of policy and planning documents from government and public health-related organizations was conducted by a research team comprised of academics and government decision-makers. Documents published between 2003 and 2011 were accessed (BC = 27; ON = 20); documents were either publicly available or internal to government and excerpted with permission. Documentary texts were deductively coded using a coding template developed by the researchers based on key health human resources concepts derived from two national policy documents. RESULTS: Documents in both provinces highlighted the importance of public health human resources planning and policies; this was particularly evident in early post-SARS documents. Key thematic areas of public health human resources identified were: education, training, and competencies; capacity; supply; intersectoral collaboration; leadership; public health planning context; and priority populations. Policy documents in both provinces discussed the importance of an educated, competent public health workforce with the appropriate skills and competencies for the effective and efficient delivery of public health services. CONCLUSION: This policy analysis identified progressive work on public health human resources policy and planning with early documents providing an inventory of issues to be addressed and later documents providing evidence of beginning policy development and implementation. While many similarities exist between the provinces, the context distinctive to each province has influenced and shaped how they have focused their public health human resources policies.'])"

I ran into a situation once when my game stagnated and I couldn't continue with the story line (I probably did something bad with one of the few servo motors in the game). As a result I was wandering around for an extended period of time revisiting every place I could to try and move the story forward. I began to notice that ammunition for all my weapons was running out at many of the shops, and enemies seemed to be dropping it less frequently, as if there was a limited supply of it. Does anyone know if _all_ items could be limited to an absolute number per game?

Alternatively, I could build a worker first, set it farming, then build my settler. Workers are significantly cheaper to produce than settlers. Perhaps the extra lead time to produce the worker would be offset by the accelerated production of the settler. But producing both the worker and the farm(s) takes time.

Also, the hauling method incurs the overhead of deployment time twice.\"},\n",

Something has to give. I believe that damage to death is more important information than health and armor counts. Maybe the health and armour count would be handy to have around to know what item should pick up first, but I believe a far more common scenario is questions like \"can I be oneshotted by a railgun this very moment\"? All of the points made in this quickly closed question do not apply to Quake 3 -- damage is distributed between armor and health independently from the source¹. There are no side effects to having low health. In my opinion, this would also help understand what these numbers really mean. Say, for example, you have 25 health and 0 armour, then picked a red armour. Now you have 25 health and 100 armour. Quick: will a railgun (110 damage) oneshot you? [Answer: yes. Indeed, 75 damage are enough to kill you (-25 to health, -50 to armour). Good luck calculating that during the game…] The only real downside would be not knowing what I should be looking for: health or armor. _However_ , I believe this is a question separate armour and health bars would answer more than adequately. (more on this below) Is there something I\\'m missing from the big picture? Why is there no mod that tries to do this? Is keeping different counters this important in Quake Live? ¹The only difference would be for the lightning gun, which due to rounding deals 5 armor damage and only 2 health damage. * * * EDIT: To make myself crystal clear here, I\\'ll post a picture of what I had in mind: ![Please note the separate bars!](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2ARIn.png) Separate bars would answer the \"what I should be looking for: health or armor\" question, but the actual numbers (the \"count\") wouldn\\'t be displayed. _Why_ would you want it?

I\\'m currently about halfway to leveling up again -- this time to 20, which would get me the next achievement. I\\'m trying to avoid gaining or losing karma at _least_ until I level up again. I haven\\'t done too many quests, oddly, mostly for fear of the karma gain/loss. Also, oddly, I haven\\'t really explored much of the world. (I haven\\'t even been to Minefield! I lied to Moira ... ) It looks like I\\'ll need < 500 XP to get this next level and its corresponding achievement. After that, I can be good (or evil) as needed until I\\'m close to level 30. What are some places I can go, or quests I can do, which will have no effect on karma, but gain me enough XP so I can get this achievement and get on with the game? In order to help with this a bit, here are the quests (off the top of my head) that I\\'ve completed:   * Wasteland Survival Guide   * Power of the Atom   * Main storyline until I\\'m told to go find Dad in a vault   * Operation: Anchorage   * Mothership Zeta    * Reilly\\'s Rangers   * Blood Ties   * Stealing Independence   * The Replicated Man Aside from locations needed for those quests, here are some of the other places I\\'ve already visited (and in most cases, cleared, if they were hostile):   * Museum of History (including Underworld and all other levels, all Lincoln artifacts retrieved)   * Rivet City   * Megaton (which is still standing)   * Arlington Library   * \"Enough\" of the metro to have gotten me through the portions of the storyline I\\'ve completed   * Only a few places in DC proper (those needed for the missions above)   * MDPL-13 power station (but not cleared, just \"en route\" to Mothership Zeta) Like I said, I just need a few hundred XP until I feel safe and comfortable continuing to do the real missions. :) I do have all the DLC, but don\\'t feel like doing The Pitt nor Point Lookout just yet. **Edit:** To clarify, I\\'m either looking for side quests which have no karmic ramifications, or I\\'m looking for other sources of non-karmic XP. (In the latter case, most likely places to go clear of already-hostile creatures, such as feral ghouls or super mutants.) Anything that can non-karmically take me up a few thousand XP fairly rapidly to get me to level 20 where the achievement is. At that point, I can go back to doing whatever I want, because I already know how to balance it all out. (EG, I have a stockpile of scrap metal to hand Walter for free, a bunch of caps for church donations, a bunch of purified water for Carlos, and am not at all above breaking & entering & looting people\\'s homes. :)'},\n",

If I\\'m facing a level 3 Akali who has **54.36 magic resist (35% reduced damage)** , when I use Vorpal Blade on her, does it do damage based on:   * Her magic resist minus my magic penetration: (45.81 magic resist = 31% reduced damage = **65.55 damage** )   * Her magic resist minus a percentage of my Vorpal damage: (54.36 magic resist - (8.55% * 95) = 46.23 magic resist = 32% reduced damage = **64.6 damage** )   * Her magic resist minus a percentage of her magic resist: (54.36 * 91.45% = 49.71 magic resist = 33% reduced damage = **63.65 damage** ) The reason this confuses me is that the **Void Staff provides 40% magic penetration**.

I've tried sneaking behind him and unloading with little success, often leaving him at full hit points. What's worse if he turns his staff into a sheep stick I'm even more behind. I'm most concerned with 1v1 in the 10-12 level area. -edit- I do notice the opponent running away to refill mana but usually he isnt gone long.

I reloaded to an older save and entered area with less than 10 items, it didn't work.   * Using this fix. It corrupted all of my savegames.

       "  'Document Description': 'I recently brought my Paladin up past lvl 60 (using my usual solo-ing techniques). I\\'ve decided I want to do the rest of this \\'toon\\'s leveling through random dungeon instances (as an experiment). Normally I don\\'t like LFG PUGs (pick-up groups found through the newish \"Looking For Group\" interface) because they usually seem to be frenetic and impatient. (Yeah, my usual style could be described as methodical and almost sedately paced). So I\\'m somewhat less experienced with LFG PUGs than I am with other aspects of the game. This Pally is dual spec\\'d (healadin/tankadin). When I\\'ve tanked it seems to work reasonably well. Feedback I get from others is generally positive and I don\\'t seem to have issues with mana regen nor too many problem losing aggro (I can usually pull back the mobs that peel off of me before any clothie bites it). However, when I\\'m trying to heal I\\'m apparently not doing so well. I got kicked from two PUGs in a row yesterday simply because I was having to drink after almost every trash skirmish. I was spending almost all my time doing Holy Light, Flash of Light and, in the latter case, keeping Beacon of Light on the tank. I was barely able to do any off healing and did almost no contribution to DPS. Here\\'s the exported talent build: Healadin Build: lvl 63 Currently I have major Glyph of Divinity, Glyph of Beacon of Light, and minor Glyph of Lay on Hands and Glyph of Blessing of Wisdom. My gear is a hodge podge mostly picked up from the AH on the same day that I leveled ... though I\\'m favoring MP/5 where I have a choice. (GearScore 898 --- +7657 armor, +88 str, +87 int, +41 manareg, +34 ap, +12 dodge, and so on). When healing I have been using Concentration Aura and buff with Greater Blessing of Wisdom and Seal of Wisdom. (However, I\\'m suspicious of the latter of these buffs, no benefit unless I\\'m doing some melee). So, my question is what would be some improvements I could make? What gear would be good for healing (and preferably not require me to mess with carrying around separate gear for tanking)? Are there better glyphs I should be using? Tweaks to my talent tree? Better buffs (including food buffs)? As I said it appears that mana regen is my biggest issue ... though I also feel like my casting time it too slow (haste rating?). (Incidentally I\\'m willing to consider that the problem may have been those two tanks. I know everyone complains about tanks all the time. So I\\'m hesitant to blame it on them. However, they were both DKs and I didn\\'t look at their gear or specs ... but I don\\'t think either of them were wielding a shield. Lvl 60/61 DKs are sorta fresh out of their starting areas and many of them seem to be much better at DPS and off-tanking than as primary tanks. It did feel like they were pulling way more trash at each skirmish than they needed to, and they would charge right from one skirmish to the next without checking my mana bar. I\\'m mostly here responding to their complaints that I was spending too much time drinking ... looking for ways to improve on that).'},\n",

My current strat which got me to about 76% using path 1, is to mass battle cruisers and vikings. On the ground I use a few tanks and some flame towers. For my next attempt, I will try mass BCs and Vikings, but will use a barracks wall at the choke points.

I have no reference for how much longer 2 points of Duration will give me though. Is that just straight up 2 seconds? On the other hand, upgrading the Plasma Cutter might also help with the damage prevention. I'm not sure though. I don't plan on going for the Plasma Cutter only playthrough yet because it's just my first run.\"},\n",

I'm fairly certain I have all the dependencies: I've installed:   * ncurses   * ncursesw   * libsdl   * libsdl-image   * libgtk   * libglu   * libopenal1 I had to turn sound off or it will instantly segfault, and I set the display mode to text. I've made no other changes to the config. However, even before I go near dfterm, it won't run properly. It just displays a blank screen. What could be causing this? Is their a dependency I missed? Is there something else I should have changed in the config? **EDIT:** This has been asked and answered on the Ubuntu StackExchange.\"},\n",
